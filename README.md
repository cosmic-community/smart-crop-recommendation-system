## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> "**PROJECT TITLE:** State-Specific Smart Crop Recommendation System (India)
> 
> **I. PROJECT GOAL & CONTEXT**
> 1.  **Primary Objective:** To develop a dynamic, data-driven web application that provides precise crop recommendations and real-time market data (including current weather and marketing price in INR) for specific Indian states, based on a historical Kaggle dataset and generated soil parameters.
> 2.  **Target Audience:** Indian farmers, agricultural students, and academic researchers focused on crop yield optimization.
> 3.  **Success Metric:** The application must successfully generate a recommendation based on imputed N, P, K, pH, and weather data, and clearly display all required output fields (including image and pricing) upon clicking the "Get recommendation" button.
> 4.  **Platform/Technology Context:** This app is being built using a [Web App Builder / AI Coding Assistant]. The output must be a clear, step-by-step **Project Plan** outlining the data ingestion, ML/logic layer implementation, database structure, and modern component setup.
> 
> **II. CORE FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITY**
> The application will operate with a single Public/Guest user flow, driven by two key buttons:
> 
> 1.  **"Select state" Button Functionality (Data Display):**
>     * **Action:** When clicked, the main display area of the application must prioritize the crop data for the state **"Telangana"**.
>     * **Output Layout:** Immediately below the distinct data display for Telangana, the system must show a summarized or filtered view of the crop data for the **remaining 5 required states:** Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, and Haryana.
>     * **Dataset Filter Constraint:** The entire app must only process data related to these six states: **Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, and Haryana.**
> 
> 2.  **"Get recommendation" Button Functionality (ML/Logic Trigger):**
>     * **Action:** Triggers the underlying machine learning/logic model to process the current state/user inputs (or simulated/auto-generated inputs) and generate a single optimal crop recommendation.
>     * **Recommendation Output:** The output must be presented in a visually appealing, auto-generated card format for the recommended crop, including:
>         * **Crop Image:** A real-life image of the recommended crop .
>         * **Soil/Climate Metrics:** Display predicted or optimal values for **N, P, K, and pH value** (simulated soil data), and **Humidity and Annual Rainfall** (simulated/real-time weather data).
>         * **Real-time Metrics:** Display the current **Marketing Price** for the recommended crop, fetched using a real-life API, and clearly stated in **Indian Rupees (INR)**.
>         * **Real-time Weather:** Display the current **Weather API data** (e.g., Temperature, Weather Condition) for the recommended state.
> 
> **III. DATA STRUCTURE (The Database & Logic Layer)**
> The application must manage data using the following logic and structure:
> 
> 1.  **Source Data Table (Based on `crop_yield.csv`):** Columns: `Crop`, `Crop_Year`, `Season`, `State`, `Area`, `Production`, `Annual_Rainfall`, `Fertilizer`, `Pesticide`, `Yield`. *Data must be filtered for the 6 required states only.*
> 2.  **ML/Logic Layer:** A crucial component must be implemented to automatically impute or look up the required missing parameters based on the existing data.
> 3.  **Recommendation Table (Inferred/Calculated):** Must store/calculate the optimal data points for a given Crop and State: `Crop_Name`, **`N_Value`**, **`P_Value`**, **`K_Value`**, **`pH_Value`**, **`Optimal_Humidity`**, **`Optimal_Annual_Rainfall`**.
> 
> **IV. DATA CONSTRAINTS & REQUIREMENTS (Critical)**
> * **Non-Negative Values:** The output values for N, P, K, Humidity, and Annual Rainfall must **never be negative**. They must be generated or processed to be $\ge 0$.
> * **pH Constraint:** The pH value must strictly range between **0 and 10**. Values from 0 to 9 can be floating-point numbers (e.g., 6.5, 7.1), and 10 is the maximum final integer value.
> * **API Integration:** Reserve clear placeholders for API keys for Weather Data and Marketing Price. Ensure the Marketing Price output is clearly formatted in **Indian Rupees (INR)**.
> 
> **V. USER INTERFACE (UI) & EXPERIENCE (UX)**
> 1.  **Design Style:** **Clean and modern**. Use a professional, vibrant, and engaging color palette suitable for an agricultural technology application.
> 2.  **Required Screens:** [Landing Page / Main Dashboard] - All functionality must be accessible on a single, clean page without sign-up/login.
> 3.  **Mandatory Components:**
>     * A prominent, centralized **Output Card** for the "Get recommendation" result.
>     * Two distinct, primary action buttons: **"Select state"** and **"Get recommendation"**.
>     * A dedicated section/table to display the **Telangana data** prominently.
>     * A secondary section/table to display the **Other 5 States' data**.
> 
> **VI. VALUE ADDITION (The "Interesting" Factor)**
> * **Risk/Reward Metric:** After the primary recommendation output, add a simple, auto-generated metric called **"Yield Predictor Score (YPS)"** (e.g., a value from 1 to 100) that factors in the current market price (INR) and the predicted yield from the CSV data. This provides a single, instant business-viability rating for the recommended crop.
> 
> **VII. FINAL OUTPUT REQUEST**
> Generate a complete, structured **Project Plan**. This plan must include:
> 1.  A confirmation of the **Data Schema** (Source and Recommendation Tables, including all N, P, K, pH, and constraint notes).
> 2.  A detailed list of the **Components/Blocks** needed for the main screen (e.g., *Header, Recommendation Card Component, State Data Table Component, two Button Components*).
> 3.  A suggested **development timeline** (e.g., *Phase 1: Data Ingestion and Filtering; Phase 2: ML/Logic Layer Implementation (NPK Imputation); Phase 3: UI/UX and API Integration*)."
